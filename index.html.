    <h2>Profile</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Richard Pearce, and I am a student at the University of New Mexico majoring in Mass Communication with a minor in Business Management. 
        I am originally from Birmingham, Alabama, and I have always been passionate about leadership and teamwork. 
        As a collegiate athlete, I have learned discipline, responsibility, and how to manage both academics and athletics effectively. 
        These experiences have shaped me into a determined and focused individual who is always striving to improve.
    </p>

    <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
    <p>
        I have gained management experience through my time working at Zaxby’s in high school and by co-owning and managing my wife’s bakery, Divine Craving. 
        In addition, I am the co-founder of 505 Trench Kings, a football training business that helps athletes develop their skills. 
        My background as a team captain in football has prepared me to lead and mentor others on and off the field. 
        I am passionate about building a successful career in management while continuing to make a positive impact in my community.
